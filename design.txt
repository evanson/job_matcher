*Job Seekers*
Profile has field of work (category), a list of skills + years of
experience
When a Job seeker logs in, they see a list of job matches


[Posting a Job]
Select category - eg IT & Programming
Add required skills.
Add optional skills.
Add required years of experience

Each category has predefined skills, but also allows users to add
their own

When a job is posted, a background task is spawned that matches the
job to job seekers, creating `JobMatch` objects in the process

A cron job runs daily, sending job matches to job seekers. A job
seeker can tick 'interested/not interested' for each job

When seeker clicks interested/not interested, the JobMatch is marked
as such

The job poster can see a list of matching candidates for each job,
with a field showing the matching skills



[Job Matching]
Match years of experience required with job seeker years of experience
& required skills with listed skills of job seekers in that category

Strong match, medium match, weak match -> Use python set operations ie
set comparison of required skills & job seeker skills

Matching is done only for available candidates

Include a score for the match: 
    -> Skill match
            less than skill match - 1 point
            exact skill match     - 2 points
            greater than skill match - 3 points

    -> Years of experience
            years of experience matching job requirement - 1 point
            years of experience exceeding job requirement - 0.5 points for
                                                            each extra
                                                            year
            years of experience less than requirement - 0 points

Strong match - (exact skill match + years greater than needed
    experience) or (greater skill match + exact years of experience)
    or (greater skill match + years greater than needed)
Exact match - (exact skill match + exact years needed)

Weak match - (exact skill match + less years of experience) or (less
skill match + exact years of experience) or (less skill match + less
years of experience) or (greater skill match + less years of
experience) or (less skill match + greater years of experience)

Optional skills - add points to the score
                  less than skill match - 0.25 points
                  exact skill match     - 0.5 points
                  greater than skill match - 0.75 points
